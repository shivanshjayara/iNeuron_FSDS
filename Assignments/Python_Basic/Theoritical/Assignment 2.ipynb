    "<!-- 1. What are the Boolean data type's two values? How do you go about writing them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Two type: True and False. We write comparison operators to get them in return like \n",

    "3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?\n",
    "Ans. Equal to(==): This is equal to operator in python. It will check the True value of the variable whether it’s value is that or not. E.g: if a==10:  print(‘It exist’)\n",
    "Assignment Operator(=): This is assignment operator. This is use to initialise the value in some variable. That mean that variable will get a space in the memory where it will have that value. E.g: b=10 Here b is initialised with the value 10. This value will get allocated in the memory\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Describe a condition and when you would use one.\n",
    "Ans. Condition is something like an eligibility criteria. If you pass that criteria, you will get into next step else you will fail. Example:\n",

    "Ans.  CTRL+C\n",

    "Ans.  Output wise there is no difference. It is just a different notation however result will be same.\n",
