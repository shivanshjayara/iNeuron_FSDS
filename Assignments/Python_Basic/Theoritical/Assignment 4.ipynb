    "Ans. It is blank list\n",

    "**6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. 1. list.index() function return the very first index position in the given parenthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. It will add the value at the end. [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True,99]\n",

    "**8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. It will permanentaly delete the respective character which encounter at thevery first satge\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans. list concatenation: +\n",

    "     \n",
    "**10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. append(): It will add the whole data whether it is a int or string or list or tuple, etc. It will not prsed the data\n",
    "    extend.(): It will parse the data and add those into the older list.\n",
    "    Eg: l=[1,2,3,4]\n",

    "Ans. l.remove(value): This will delete the mentioned value. If value is more than one time then it will remove it by its order.\n",
    "\n",
    "l.pop(): This will deletethe last value in the list\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. By indexing we can do the string operation on the list value if it is a string.\n",
    "Example: b=[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True]\n",
    "b[1].index('t') --> 2\n",

    "**13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. List: It is mutable i.e. we can change, replace or update the value in the list. List allow these things.\n",
    "    Tuple: It is immutable i.e. we cannot do the above things like replace, change, update the values. Tuple do not allow this.\n",
    "    This is the main difference between List and Tuple. Fo the security reasons tuples are very important.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "**14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. t=(42,)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. We can use the zip function for that. Example:\n",
    "l1=[1,2,3]\n",
    "l2=[10,11,12]\n",
    "\n",
    "z1=list(zip(l1,l2))\n",
    "o/p: [(1,10),(2,11),(3,12)]   list form of a tuple value\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Example: l=[1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "Here l is a variable or we can say a object for list class. We have initialise the list with its value. Here l is refering the list values [1,2,3,4,5] It contains the reference of the list values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans copy.deepcopy(): This inndicate the deep copy. With this the data of the original object,say ob1, will get copied into other object,say ob2. Whenever there is a change in the new object ob2, then it will not affect the datas of original object ob1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "copy.copy(): This is opposite of the deep copy. Any change in the new object copied object will affect the datas in original object.\n",
