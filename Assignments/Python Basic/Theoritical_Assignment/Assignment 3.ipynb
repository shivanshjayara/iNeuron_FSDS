    "**1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "*Built-in functions*: It helps to make the task easier and in short cut manner. By using the function during our code for any task, it takes less time to execute. Apart from this we do not have to write that much long code for any execution. \n",
    "Like if we want to find a length of a string. Then instead of using loop and increasing the count, we can use len(string) to get the length of a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "*User define function*: These functions are build by the user. Once the user define a function, all the operation are comes under it. And suppose there are many elements for which the same coding is required, then here comes the advantage of function. We do not need to writ ethe whole code form the beginning. We just need to call the function as per requirement. Even we can edit the coding for all the elements at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. When does the code in a function execute: when the function is defined or when the function is called?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.  The function gets executed when it is being called.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What statement creates a function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Def statement creates the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Function It is simply the name, inside which the entire required statements comes. Example. def total() : Here total is a function.\n",
    "Function call It’s symbol is function(). These parenthesis indicates that the function is being called. After the function is called then only the function gets executed and returns the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.  Suppose we have assign a variable a=10 above the function. Then again we assign a new variable ‘a’=5 inside the function. So when the function gets called then the variable ‘a’ which was locally assigned, return later value 5. It will not consider the value which was globally assigned\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. What is a return value? Can a return value be part of an expression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Return values is a value that is returning back to the function. It gets stored in the system and until and unless we do not required it doesn’t displayed.Yes it is a part of an expression. \n",
    "Example: def t():\n",
    "    return 5+3\n",
    "t()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. It will return nothing. It will completely blank.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. How can you force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. By using a keyword ‘global’ before that variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. What is the data type of None?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. None type\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. What does the import areallyourpetsnamederic statement do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.  This will import the module ‘areallyourpetsnamederic’\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**12. If you had a function named bacon() in a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Import spam\n",
    "spam.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**13. How can you prevent a program from crashing when it gets an error?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans By using ‘try’ and ‘except’ block. Execution code will be written in ‘try’ block and self defined error will be written in ‘except’ block.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**14. What goes in the try clause? What goes in the except clause?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.  Execution code will be written in ‘try’ block and self defined error will be written in ‘except’ block \n",
    "Example:\n",
    "try:\n",
    "num=int(input(‘Enter the value’))  \n",
    "print(num)\n",
    "except:\n",
    "\tprint(‘It must be a number not a string’)\n"
